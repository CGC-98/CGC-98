- 👋 Hello, there! I’m @CGC-98, which stands for "Caíque Gama Correia" and "1998".
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, and also uninterested in many others. I'd say learning is a passion and a curse, so bring it in!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development at Trybe Course. Excitement is only the beginning of how I'm feeling about it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my personal and professional life first. Only then can I say I'll be able to make some difference.
- 📫 How to reach me... That's a good question! I'll let you know once I figure it out ~
